# TODO

- style fixes
  - elements with :focus
  - section-hero-widget should be 100vh so next section is revealed with animation
  - section-generic-widget image should cover the cell area
  - section-list-widget not enough room for text on medium-width screen
  - remove margin-bottom for last item in apos-area, margin-top for first item in apos-area (button-set-widget margin looks funny in section-banner-widget)
- add favicon.ico
- use morph-text-widget in hero instead of typed-text-widget - https://codepen.io/Valgo/pen/PowZaNY
