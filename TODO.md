# TODO

- contact section
- blog section
- ld-json
  - person - https://schema.org/Person
  - article - https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/article
- style fixes
  - section-hero-widget should be 100vh so next section is revealed with animation
  - section-generic-widget image should cover the cell area & have options for object-fit & object-position
  - section-list-widget items with lots of text look bad on medium-width screen
  - remove margin-bottom for last item in apos-area, margin-top for first item in apos-area (button-set-widget margin looks funny in section-banner-widget)
- add favicon.ico
- use morph-text-widget in hero instead of typed-text-widget - https://codepen.io/Valgo/pen/PowZaNY
